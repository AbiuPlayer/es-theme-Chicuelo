# Special Thanks:

EctoOne, Keygan, Cosmo0 and Movisman for giving me a huge help on the implementation of the theme. I'm very thankful for having the chance to work with you guys!


# Features:

1080 resolution and smooth, with favorites, recent and library game list.

All sprites separated and the possibility to use a system dot indicator.

A power menu is included in case you have one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Notes:

The dot indicator is not included in the Theme, its just a fake indicator made for my systems, so it won't work fine on your setup.

Game screens are not included with the theme, you can scrape your own or use the game box art or videos that it should work fine.

FOR A BETTER USER EXPERIENCE DISABLE ON-SCREEN HELP, SET THE UI TRANSITION STYLE TO INSTANT AND LOGO TRANSITIONS TO NONE
